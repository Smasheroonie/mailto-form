# mailto-form

A form I created recently as a small practice project.

To test it out, follow these steps:

1. In your terminal in VS Code or similar, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Smasheroonie/mailto-form.git
```

2. Get the Live Server extension and click Go Live in the bottom task bar.

3. In the index.html file, change the form action mailto email address from "changeme@example.com" to your own email address.

4. Fill out the form with some data and see the validation at work! (Sample test card information can be found [here.](https://docs.stripe.com/testing?locale=en-GB))

5. Click Submit and your default mail app should open automatically, with an email containing your data. If not, select a default app to open with.

6. You can send this email and it should arrive in your inbox!

Thanks for checking out my small project!
